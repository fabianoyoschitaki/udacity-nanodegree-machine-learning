In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.\n",

    "If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling â€” particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.\n",

The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many \"rules of thumb\" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.\n",
    " - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.\n",
    " - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.\n",
    " - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  \n",
    "Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`."
