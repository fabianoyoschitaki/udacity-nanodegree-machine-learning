    "## Using Supervised Classification Algorithms to Predict Income from Census Data\n",
    "Fabiano Shoji Yoschitaki  \n",
    "June 28th, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain background of this project is about predicting money income from the US Census dataset, which is an extraction done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database [1]. This dataset was donated to the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository in 1996. The Census dataset is composed of 48842 instances, 14 attributes (or features) and the target: whether or not a person's annual income exceeds 50k. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task of this problem is to determine whether someone's income is over 50k a year based on the 14 variables. Since the prediction output may be true or false, this is a binary classification problem which can be solved using supervised machine learning classification techniques [2][3].\n",
    "\n",
    "The personal reason to work on this domain background comes from the fact that I've worked on a census tool which could not provide much useful statistical information about the local economy because there was a lack of data related to people's wages and earnings. So I believe that applying machine learning techniques could have helped us to take the data we had as the training set and use the predicted output to fill the gaps in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the US Census dataset, a supervised binary classification model has to be created and trained using a subset of the entire dataset holding all the 15 features related to people (including the target output: whether or not the person makes over 50k a year) with the objective of predicting unseen people's wage based on the same features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets and Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset chosen for this project is an extraction done by Berry Becker from the 1994 US Census database. It was obtained by exploring the University of Carolina Irvine's Machine Learning Repository [4]. The dataset can be download at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income and it's composed of two CSV files containing 48842 instances with 15 columns each. The last column is the target: whether or not the person makes over 50k a year. The probability for the label '>50k' is 23.93% and for '<=50k' is 76.07%.\n",
    "The description of the columns follow:\n",
    "- **age**: the age of the person (continuous).\n",
    "- **workclass**: the workclass of the person (categorical). Possible values: Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.\n",
    "- **fnlwgt**: the final weight of the person (continuous).\n",
    "- **education**: the education level of the person (categorical). Possible values: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool.\n",
    "- **education-num**: the education level of the person (continuous).\n",
    "- **marital-status**: the marital status of the person (categorical). Possible values: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse.\n",
    "- **occupation**: the job occupation of the person (categorical). Possible values: Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces.\n",
    "- **relationship**: the relationship status of the person (categorical). Possible values: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried.\n",
    "- **race**: the race of the person (categorical). Possible values: White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black.\n",
    "- **sex**: the sex of the person (categorical). Possible values: Female, Male.\n",
    "- **capital-gain**: the income from investment sources, apart from wages or salary (continuous).\n",
    "- **capital-loss**: the losses from investment sources, apart from wages or salary (continuous).\n",
    "- **hours-per-week**: number of working hours per week (continuous).\n",
    "- **native-country**: the native country of the person (categorical). Possible values: United-States, Cambodia, England, Puerto-Rico, Canada, Germany, Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc), India, Japan, Greece, South, China, Cuba, Iran, Honduras, Philippines, Italy, Poland, Jamaica, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, Ireland, France, Dominican-Republic, Laos, Ecuador, Taiwan, Haiti, Columbia, Hungary, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Scotland, Thailand, Yugoslavia, El-Salvador, Trinadad&Tobago, Peru, Hong, Holand-Netherlands.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally the target label:\n",
    "- **income**: whether or not the person makes more than 50k a year (categorical). Possible values: >50k, <=50k. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to apply different machine learning techniques, including supervised classification algorithms, to predict money income from the US Census dataset, stated as a binary classification task. After applying the chosen supervised algorithms to the dataset, their prediction scores will be evaluated by accuracy metric and the best one (maybe more than one if we have similar high scores) will be selected so that its hyperparameters are tuned using Grid Search technique and eventually apply the newly tuned model on the same training and testing data to compare before and after scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark Model\n",
    "_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Design\n",
    "_(approx. 1 page)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.\n",
