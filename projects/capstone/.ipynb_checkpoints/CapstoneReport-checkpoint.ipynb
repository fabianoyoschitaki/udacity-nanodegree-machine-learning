    "### Project Overview\n",
    "In order to promote products and services, financial institutions like banks generally run marketing campaigns using two approaches [1]: 1) mass campaigns, which targets general indiscriminate public, broadcasting the same message to different customers and 2) directed marketing, which targets specific contacts, creating a directing relationship to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks which run marketing campaigns following the first approach have had their campaigns' performance reduced over time, having less than 1% of positive responses [2]. On the other hand, marketing campaigns which follow the second approach have shown better results compared to the first [3]. For this reason, banks are more likely to spend their budget on directed marketing campaigns than on inefficient mass campaigns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The personal reason to work on this domain background comes from the fact that I've worked on a project related to a bank company with the goal to offer the most coherent products to its customers based on their characteristics. I believe that having applied machine learning techniques could have helped us to get better response rates."

    "![Accuracy](images/accuracy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-Score metric, also known as balanced F-score or F-measure, is a metric which can be interpreted as the harmonic average of  both precision and recall metrics. This metric was considered due to the class imbalance that our dataset presents (approximately 88% 'no' vs 12% 'yes).\n",
    "\n",
    "![F1-Score](images/f1score.png)\n",

    "The dataset chosen for this project is related to direct marketing campaigns based on phone calls of a Portuguese banking institution. It was obtained by exploring the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository [5]. The dataset file which will be used is the bank-full.csv and it contains 45211 instances with 17 columns each. The last column is the target label: whether or not the person subscribed a term deposit. The probability for the label 'yes' (did a term deposit) is approximately 12% and for 'no' (didn't do a term deposit) is approximately 88%.\n",

    "    - **marital**: the marital status of the client (categorical). Possible values: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed.\n",

    "    - **duration**: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.\n",
